# Reader_Keylogger
Keylogger project: Making a executable keylogger that can be used to record keystrokes on another computer.
Planned changes:
  -Sending keys or keystrokes over the network to another computer into a text file (remote)
  -Make it a program that can be run in the background as another or customizable name

What I used so far
  -Pyinstaller to make it into a executable.
